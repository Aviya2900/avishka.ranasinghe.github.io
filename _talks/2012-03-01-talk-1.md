## Heritage-AI: Multi-Modal Reconstruction and Colourization of Historical Archival Imagery  
**Type:** NVIDIA-Granted Project  
**Grant:** ~80,000 GPU-hours on NVIDIA A100 Compute Units  
**Duration:** Aug 2025 – Present  

### Objective  
To develop a multi-modal framework integrating **Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)** and **Diffusion Models** for reconstructing and colourizing historical archival imagery of Sri Lanka.

### Contributions  
- Secured an **NVIDIA compute grant** (equivalent to ~$700,000 worth of GPU hours) through a jointly developed proposal.  
- Utilizing **COSMO-RC (Complex Sinusoidal Modulation for INRs)** for high-fidelity blemish removal, denoising, and super-resolution.  
- Integrating **Iso-Diffusion** (by an associate group) for realistic colour restoration.  
- Collaborated with the **Department of Archaeology** to curate archival photographs and artistic material from the late Kandy Kingdom.  
- Future extensions include **3D scene reconstruction** of Kandy city inspired by modern street-view mapping workflows.

## PH-Based Topological Hypergraph Construction for Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition  
**Duration:** Apr 2025 – Present  

### Objective  
To design a topological framework for analyzing skeletal joint behavior across different human actions, enabling the extraction of stable higher-order joint relationships.

### Contributions  
- Evaluated existing hypergraph-based methods for action recognition and identified important topological patterns that influence many actions.  
- Developed a **differentiable clustering model inspired by Persistent Homology (PH)** to construct robust hyperedge incidence matrices—an approach not previously explored in this domain.  
- Currently validating performance across standard skeleton-based action recognition datasets and configurations.

## Dynamic Multi-View Angular Encoding for 3D Skeleton Sequences  
**Status:** Published in a Peer-Reviewed Venue  
**Duration:** Dec 2024 – Apr 2025  

### Objective  
To introduce a dynamic angular encoder that generates a complementary feature stream to raw 3D joint coordinates for improved skeleton-based action recognition.

### Contributions  
- Observed that action perception varies with viewing direction and evolves over time.  
- Designed a **self-attention–based mechanism** that learns **anchor points** from which angular information is extracted dynamically.  
- Enabled the model to capture evolving angular cues over time, improving predictive accuracy.  
- Outperformed existing angular encoders, providing noise-resilient and complementary feature representations.  
- Demonstrated strong generalization and scalability across datasets in peer-reviewed publication.
